HDRP issues:
Missing shadows from Area Lights or Mixed lights?
1. Search for DefaultHDRPAsset from HDRPDefaultResources (Unity 2020).
2. From Lightning -> Shadows, enable Shadowmask.
3. Make sure Project Settings -> Quality uses the correct quality level for the shadows to appear. 

Some materials look strange, such as plants and curtains?
This is due to missing Diffusion profiles from your HDRP asset file. Package has two Diffusion profiles that needs to be added to your HDRP asset.
Select Curtains_clean material and click fix in Diffusion Profile. Do the same for Interior_plants_clean material.

Exterior feels too bright?
Select PostProcessing game object and set Exposure to Automatic.

HDRP version 10:
Set Exposure Compensation to 0 from game object Post Processing -> Exposure.
